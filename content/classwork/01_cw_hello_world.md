The objective of this exercise is to create a java file, add it, commit and push to a remote repository.

1. In your local machine, go to the folder where your assignments repo was cloned `...../APCSA1/apcsa-assignments-fall-YourUsername/`, execute `git pull` and create a folder classwork.
2. Create a folder 09_09_hello_world inside the classwork folder.
3. Write a java file HelloWorld.java that prints the message "Hello World!".
4. Run `git status`. What does it show?
5. To add the new file to the repository, run the following command from the root (top-level) of your repo, not from inside the classwork folder: `git add classwork/09_09_hello_world/HelloWorld.java`
6. Run `git status` again. What does it show this time?
7. Commit and push the file to your repo.
8. Go to GitHub, HelloWorld.java should be there.
