title: CW 29 - Insertion Sort

## Directions:

* You must implement insertion sort. Use the following method signature:

`public static void insertionSort(int[] data) `

* Please do NOT change the method signature.

* Do not use ArrayList.

* Your methods must not produce any output when they finish. Although using print statements during debugging is fine, they should be completely removed in your final submission.
  
* Once you create an array to test your method, make a copy of it. This allows you to compare the results of your sort with Java’s built-in sort (Arrays.sort(yourArray)), using the original array for your method and the copied array for the built-in method.
